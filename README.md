## Work Management App
Give the user the ability to add their completed work to a database. 

#### The app allow you to:
* Record the number of hours worked on a specific date
* Record task accomplished on this day 
* Visualize the whole data recorded
* Visualize the total number of hours worked

## How To Use
Download the source code to your local computer, then compile it with your favorite compiler (I use g++ on macOS). Once compiled, you can start adding your working time to the database (the **.dat** file will be automatically created on your disk).
