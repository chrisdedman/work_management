## Time Worked Management
Give the user the ability to add their completed work to a database. The user can register his time worked according to the date of work as well as the task accomplished on this day. The user has the possibility to visualize the complete content of the database as well as the total number of hours worked.

### How To Use
Download the source code to your local computer, then compile it with your favorite compiler (I use g++ on macOS). Once compiled, you can start adding your working time to the database (the **.dat** file will be automatically created on your disk).
